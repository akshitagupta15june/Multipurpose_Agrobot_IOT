## Problem Statement / Purpose of Project
DESIGN COST EFFECTIVE BUSINESS SOLUTION WITH GOOD USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MECHANISATION FOR SUSTAINABLE AND COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURE, FARMING.

## PRINCIPLE AND FEATURES OF AGROBOT

The main impact for our project has been to develop a solar operated digging machine, which is solar powered. In this machine, we used a solar panel to capture and convert solar energy into electrical energy which is used to charge a 5v battery. Which gives the necessary power to a DC motor. With the help of Bluetooth modules, we connect all the commands through our remote. This power is transmitted to the rear wheel through gears. In this project it makes the electric and mechanical systems share their power in efficient way. It reduces the running cost of digging machine.
