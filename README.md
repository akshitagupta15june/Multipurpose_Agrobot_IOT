# Multipurpose_Agrobot_IOT
## Problem Statement / Purpose of Project
DESIGN COST EFFECTIVE BUSINESS SOLUTION WITH GOOD USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MECHANISATION FOR SUSTAINABLE AND COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURE, FARMING.

## PRINCIPLE AND FEATURES OF AGROBOT

The main impact for our project has been to develop a solar operated digging machine, which is solar powered. In this machine, we used a solar panel to capture and convert solar energy into electrical energy which is used to charge a 5v battery. Which gives the necessary power to a DC motor. With the help of Bluetooth modules, we connect all the commands through our remote. This power is transmitted to the rear wheel through gears. In this project it makes the electric and mechanical systems share their power in efficient way. It reduces the running cost of digging machine.

## Features

    • Automatic grass cutter
    
    • Automatic seedling Sprinkling
    
    • Fertilizer Sprinkling
    
    • Irrigation & Hydraulic cultivator
    
    • Solar power operated

    • Automated with remote
    
Multipurpose agriculture robot can perform the following 

functions and advantages-: 

• Robot vehicle can dig the soil, put the seeds, spray water as well as it can cut the grains/grass. It will reduce human effort in agricultural field. 

• To perform all 4 operations at single time, hence increases production and saves time. Farmers can operate this robot through remote by sitting at a place and can easily operate. 

• The usage to solar can be utilized for battery charging. As robot works in field, the rays of sun can be used for solar power generation (increases power output). Robot can move automatically in field.
